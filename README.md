# Farm Site Project

Welcome to the Farm Site project! This is a frontend web application built with Vite, TypeScript, and React. The project simulates a farm site where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. Local storage, JSON, and session storage are utilized to simulate a database.
